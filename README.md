# React Testing Library POC for react-beautiful-dnd

* react-beautiful-dnd is a great library, but there existed few, if any,
working examples of testing moving Draggable items between listes (Droppables) on the Internet.
* This repo uses a very simple app to show how to mock the relevant parts of visual layout in jsdom
to get react-beautiful-dnd to work so that I can test it in my unit and integration tests.
